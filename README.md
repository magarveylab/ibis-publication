## Installation
Install the package via pip symlinks.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ibispub
pip install -e .
```
Replace the contents of the `Ibis/Models` with the Models.zip file obtained from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14246984)

## Training
The scripts for training the following models are included:
1. [IBIS-Enzyme](https://github.com/magarveylab/ibis-transformer-training/tree/main/training/ibis_enzyme): A Transformer-based model designed to embed protein sequences by capturing patterns associated with enzyme commission numbers, proteins involved in specialized metabolism, and RiPP classes. Additionally, the model predicts residues corresponding to domains within multi-modular assembly proteins (e.g., Type I polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase), as well as propeptide designation.
2. [IBIS-Domain](https://github.com/magarveylab/ibis-transformer-training/tree/main/training/ibis_domain): A Transformer-based model that embeds protein domains by identifying patterns relevant to substrate prediction for adenylation and acyltransferase domains. It also distinguishes between functional and inactive states for ketosynthase, ketoreductase, enoylreductase, and dehydratase domains. Furthermore, the model encodes domain subclasses, such as thiolation domains involved in Î²-branching cascades within polyketide biosynthesis.
3. [IBIS-SM]
4. [IBIS-BGC]

## Inference

## Web Platform
A dedicated website for presenting processed genomes from NCBI will be launched soon. In future updates, users will be able to submit internal genomes directly through the platform.
